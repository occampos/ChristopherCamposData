								<h2>Project Statement</h2>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 30px"> 
									AtliQ is a growing FMCG manufacturer, they serve customers across three seperate cities and look foward to expanding further. However, there has been a 
									noticeable trend of key customers opting not to renew their contracts with AtliQ due to service-related issues and so customer service and delivery efficiency 
									has come into question. This has prompted management to prioritize addressing these concerns before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain 
									analytics team track delivery service levels.
								</p>
								<h4>Skills Highlighted</h4>
								<ul style="margin-bottom: 30px">
									<li>Data Cleaning and Exploration with <i>Python</i>
									<li>Data Visualization with <i>Power Bi (DAX)</i> and <i>Python</i>
									<li><i>Machine Learning</i> and <i>Feature Importance</i> with <i>Python (scikit-learn)</i>
								</ul>														
								<h2>Project Description</h2>
									<p style="margin-bottom: -80px;"> 
										A Delivery Performance Dashboard was developed with Power BI to enable AtliQ analytics to effectively track delivery metrics and derive data-driven insights. Additionally, 
										a machine learning model and feature importance was employed to pinpoint the root causes of poor delivery metrics and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

										The Delivery Performance Dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of delivery operations, showcasing critical performance metrics essential for assessing performance 
										against established benchmarks. Prominently displayed are %On Time, %In Full, and %On Time and In Full compared to their targets, providing valuable insights into our ability to meet customer 
										expectations and contractual obligations. In addition to these key metrics, the dashboard tracks Line Fill Rate and Volume Fill Rate, offering valuable insights into inventory 
										management and order fulfillment capabilities. This granular analysis empowers users to drill down into delivery performance data by time, customer, and city, enabling targeted improvement 
										efforts where needed. By leveraging the insights provided by the dashboard, we are poised to enhance our delivery operations, optimize inventory management processes, and exceed customer 
										expectations with every delivery.
									</p>
									<p style="margin-top: -80px; margin-left: 80px" class="inner">
										Utilizing the dashboard reveals it's evident that crucial metrics fall short of their intended benchmarks. Orders that are both On Time and In Full underperform by over 30%. This pattern can 
										be observed in all customers and thus have valid reason to not renew their contracts with AtliQ.

									<div style="margin-left: 100px;">
										<p>
											Machine learning is also employed to further pinpoint the cause of underperforming key metrics. A model is developed that has the ability to predict whether or not a delivery is On Time,
											In Full, or both with 60% accuracy. By measuring which feature or variable had the most importance in predicting delivery status we gain nuanced insights into whats contributing to 
											metric underperformance.
											In this case "Customer" and "City" are the most important features in determining an order's delivery status suggesting that the problem may be related to specific customers, cities or
											departments that handle customer/city management. Certain customers might have unique requirements, preferences, or ordering patterns that contribute to delays. It could be that some customers 
											consistently place rush orders, have complex delivery instructions, or require special handling, which affects delivery times. Also, different cities may present various logistical 
											challenges that impact delivery times. Factors such as traffic congestion, distance from distribution centers, local regulations, or infrastructure issues could all influence delivery efficiency.

								<h2>Conclusion and Recommendation</h2>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 30px"> 
									Data analysis suggests that key customers are opting out of renewing thier contract with AtliQ due to poor delivery status metrics, a signfiicant portion of orders are late and incomplete. Further 
									analysis suggests that this underperformance is city and customer specific. 
									<br>
									A possible solution is a position soley on quality control, a quality control specialist, responsible for monitoring and 
									improving delivery performance in key cities or for specific customer segments. This individual would closely monitor metrics related to on-time and complete deliveries, identify patterns or recurring 
									issues, and develop targeted strategies to address them. 
									<br>
									Process optmization can also be a possible focus, collaboration with relevant departments to optimize processes and workflows related to delivery 
									operations in targeted cities or for specific customers. This could involve streamlining order processing, improving communication channels with customers, or optimizing delivery routes to mitigate 
									logistical challenges.
									<br>
									<br>
									Further analysis can be conducted that is customer or city specific. The quality control specialist would conduct in-depth analyses focusing on cities or customer segments exhibiting consistently poor delivery performance. 
									By understanding the unique challenges and requirements of these areas or customers, tailored solutions can be developed to address them effectively.
